英语之词汇量及同义词数居世界语言之最。这源于英语在数世纪以来不断自外语引入新词。即于诺曼征服之前，盎格鲁—萨克逊语已含有拉丁（如 street、mile 及城镇名之「彻斯特」后缀——原注，下同）、希腊（如 priest、bishop）、凯尔特（如 crag、bin）、斯堪的纳维亚（如 law、fellow、egg、thrall）借词。诺曼征服后，英语词汇实因法语词汇加入而倍增，其中反映高水准生活与更复杂社交者尤甚：如关于饮食（如 sugar、vinegar、boil、fry、roast）、衣物（如 garment、robe、mantle、gown）、法律（如 plaintiff、perjury、legacy）、宗教（如 convent、hermitage、chaplain、cardinal）、头衔及组织（prince、duke、count「伯爵」、vassal、mayor、constable）之词。

English has the largest vocabulary and the most synonyms of any language in the world. This richness is due to the fact that the English language has grown over the centuries by constantly incorporating words from other languages. Even before the Norman Conquest, the Anglo-Saxon vocabulary included words borrowed from Latin ( street, mile, the suffix -Chester in the names of towns), Greek (priest, bishop), Celtic (crag, bin), and Scandinavian (law, fellow, egg, thrall). After the Norman Conquest, the English vocabulary was virtually doubled by the addition of French words, especially those reflecting a higher standard of living and a more complex social life: for example, words connected with food (sugar, vinegar, boil, fry, roast), clothing (garment, robe, mantle, gown), law (plaintiff, perjury, legacy), religion (convent , hermitage, chaplain, cardinal), and social rank and organization (prince, duke, count, vassal, mayor, constable).

尽管法语新词多以描述新事物，亦有许多与既存之盎格鲁—萨克逊词汇重复，使人著述与交谈时得以挑选同义词：如 cure（法）同 heal（盎萨）、table 同 board、poignant 同 sharp、labour 同 work、mirror 同 glass、assemble 同 meet、power 同 might。有些赘余词汇用以区分词义：待宰之 ox、swine、calf、deer 将做成 beef、pork、veal、venison；而 hitting、sriking、stealing、robbing 以法国法律观之，则为 assault、battery、larceny、burglary。

While much of the new French vocabulary described new ideas and activities, much of it duplicated the pre-existing Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, giving the writer or speaker a choice of synonyms: cure (French) or heal (Anglo-Saxon), table or board, poignant or sharp, labor or work, mirror or glass, assemble or meet, power or might. Sometimes the duplication of vocabulary was used to make distinctions, ox, swine, calf, and deer were called, when killed and prepared for cooking, beef, pork , veal, and venison; hitting, striking, stealing, and robbing became, when viewed through the eyes of French law, assault, battery, larceny, and burglary.

当文艺复兴时期经典学习盛行，源自拉丁、希腊语之词汇再度涌入英语，应增广的知识文化需求而被称说。另外，十字军东征以降，民众因远游发现更大世界，外加以伊丽莎白时期为最之探险，极大刺激了文化与语言。终致于 16 世纪，从拉丁、希腊语寻章摘句妆点言语一时成风，此等辞藻当时以 aureate 或 inkhorn 形容。熟知的莎士比亚之语「multitudinous seas incarnadine」（无边赤色之海——译注）可以为据，这两词又代表此类新词之处境：multitudinous 于英语中留为 many 之同义词，incarnadine 则于《麦克白》外寂寂无闻。一言以蔽之，文艺复兴时期源于经典之词，不少永久融入英语，但更多被登时遗忘或仅用于专门语境：如 hebdemodary「每周的」与 gresorial「步行的」。

With the enormous expansion of classical learning in the Renaissance, there was a great influx of words of Latin and Greek origin into the language, dictated by the demands of an enriched intellectual and cultural life. Also, the larger world discovered through travel (from the Crusades onward) and exploration (especially in the Elizabethan period) was a great stimulus to culture and language. There also arose in the sixteenth century a fashion of ornamenting one’s discourse with what were then called “aureate” or “inkhorn” terms drawn from Greek and Latin. Shakespeare’s “multitudinous seas incarnadine” is a famous example, and what happened to these particular words is typical of the fate of this new vocabulary: multitudinous stayed in the language as one of several synonyms for many, while incarnadine is not heard any more except in this context. In brief, many words of classical origin introduced into the language during the Renaissance became permanent additions, but most were soon forgotten or were relegated to special technical contexts, like hebdemodary (weekly) and gressorial (having to do with walking).

现代，当操英语者行于世界，在欧洲、北美、印度、澳洲、非洲或贸易或杀伐时，其经历亦在扩增英语词汇。无论荷兰语（如 tub、spool、deck）、西班牙语（如 sherry、armada、grenade）、美洲印第安土语（如 squash、toboggan、hickory）、东印第安土语（如 cashmere、punch、shampoo）、南非语（如 veld、trek）、意大利语（如 soprano、casino、macaroni）、墨西哥语（如 chocolate、tomato）、澳大利亚土语（如 kangaroo、billabong）、日语（如 amok、ketchup）或其他语言，均有词汇借入。

The adventures of English-speaking people as they traded and fought and traveled around the world in modern times—in Europe, North America, India, Australia, Africa—also expanded the vocabulary. Words were borrowed from Dutch {tub, spool, deck), Spanish {sherry, armada, grenade), American Indian {squash, toboggan, hickory), East Indian {cashmere, punch, shampoo), Afrikaans {veld, trek), Italian {soprano, casino, macaroni), Mexican {chocolate, tomato), Australian {kangaroo, billabong), Japanese {kimono, ricksha), Malay {amok, ketchup), and many others.

此外，美国以其与世隔绝，生活方式与国体迥异，自殖民地时期起即快速扩充英语词汇。随着美国崛起，以致在政治、科学、工业、经贸乃至流行艺术方面影响全球，美式辞章在各地扬名。Ice-cream、jeep、rock-and-roll 家喻户晓，containment、DEW-line、nuclear deterrence 举世皆知。另外，诸多美国用语与英伦用语相伴相生，形成另一组同义词为人所用：help（美）同 servant（英）、sidewalk 同 pavement、billboard 同 hoarding、movies 同 flicks、druggist 同 chemist、installment plan 同 hire-purchase system、water-heater 同 geyser、checkers 同 draughts、soft drinks 同 mineral waters 等等，不一而足。

Furthermore, the United States, as a separate nation with its own life and character and institutions, added vastly to the English vocabulary, beginning in Colonial times. With the rise of the United States to a position of world influence in politics, science, industry, trade, and the popular arts, American words and phrases have gained recognition and prestige everywhere. Ice cream, jeep, and rock-and-roll are internationally known terms, as are containment, DEW-line, and nuclear deterrence. Moreover, American terminology for many things exists side by side with an English terminology, placing another whole group of synonyms at our service: help (American) and servant (British), sidewalk and pavement, billboard and hoarding, movies and flicks, druggist and chemist, installment plan and hire-purchase system, water-heater and geyser, checkers and draughts, soft drinks and mineral waters, and so on through an almost interminable list.

故而英语同义词有多种情况。有些同义词，如 foreword（英）、preface（法）、introduction（拉）、gomenon（希）只是徒增繁冗。有些如 plain（法）、steppe（俄）、pampas（西，从南美印第安）、prairie（法国海者）、savannah（西）、tundra（俄，从拉普兰语），指同一事物在各地之变体。余者如 teach、educate、indoctrinate、instruct、school、tutor，大体从程度或抽象上彼此相异：teach 为其中最通用者，其余在应用中有所特化。有些含义极似之词在具体的、描述的层面立异：如 tip、cant、careen、heel、list、slant、slope、tilt，又如 screech、scream、clamor、yammer、howl。只有总括前者为「倾斜」，后者为「嘶叫」，方能视之为同义。

Synonyms in English are therefore of many kinds. Some groups of synonyms, like foreword (English), preface (French), introduction (Latin), and prolegomenon (Greek), seem like a simple embarrassment of riches. Some, like plain (French), steppe (Russian), pampas (Spanish, from South American Indian), prairie (French voyageur), savannah (Spanish), tundra (Russian, from Lappish), refer to geographical variants of the same kind of thing. Others, like teach, educate, indoctrinate, instruct, school, tutor, differ from each other principally in degrees of abstraction: teach is certainly the most general word of this group, while the others are more specialized in application. Some words of quite similar meaning make distinctions at the concrete, descriptive level: tip, cant, careen, heel, list, slant, slope, tilt; screech, scream, clamor, yammer, howl. These are truly synonyms only if translated into more general form, the former group into incline, the latter into outcry.

可以辩称，不存在真正的「同义词」——词义不会 100％ 一致。若认为「词义」指某词或然出现之范围，诚不可能有两词在任何语境均可互换，这将支持前一论点。但在指定语境中，必然有词完全同义：如 I mislaid my wallet 与 I misplaced my wallet。但在微殊之语境下，两词则无法互换：I mislaid my suitcase 不被惯称——此两种情况表明 misplace 无论大小物件均可使用，mislay 仅用于小者。另外，misplaced trust 或许令人失落，但不说成 mislaid trust。此事再度说明，某一义项上同义之词或于其他义项截然不同。

It can be argued that there really are no exact synonyms—no exact equivalences of meaning. Such a position can be upheld if by “meaning” we refer to the total range of contexts in which a word may be used. Certainly there are no two words that are interchangeable in all the contexts in which either might appear. But within a given context, there is often exact synonymy: I mislaid my wallet; I misplaced my wallet. In a slightly different context, however, the two words are not interchangeable: it would not be idiomatic to say, I mislaid my suitcase —all of which may suggest that while misplace is applicable to both small objects and large, mislay applies only to small. Also, one may suffer disappointment because of misplaced, but never mislaid, trust. This example shows again that words which are synonymous in one of their meanings may differ considerably in their other meanings.

部分同义词表达同一动作，但强调与客体之不同关系。对同僚称 accompany，对上级则言 attend、follow，对需指导者用 accompany，对应保护者用 escort，对得监视者用 chaperone，战时商船务以 convoy。又如 feminine、effeminate、womanly、womanish 皆以形容女性特质，惟第二词用以贬称男性。

Some groups of words describe the same actions, but imply different relationships among the parties concerned. We accompany our equals; we attend or follow those to whom we are subordinate; we conduct those who need guidance, escort those who need protection, and chaperone those who need supervision; merchant ships are convoyed in time of war. Feminine, effeminate, womanly, and womanish are much alike in referring to female characteristics, but the second applies only to males, and then in a derogatory sense.

语风之别有时揭示所述场合之正式程度，如 luncheon 之别于 lunch；有时不表示场合本身而是相关交谈之正式程度，如 He went to bed 之别于 He hit the sack。

Some differences in locution reveal differences in the degree of formality of the occasions described: a luncheon as distinguished from a lunch. Sometimes different locutions reveal differences not in the situations described but in the formality of discourse about them: He went to bed, for instance, as compared to He hit the sack. 

语义学家及语言学家不断提醒，词义随时间、地点、环境而变。此番警告不应轻视。瑞典民主不同于同样号称「民主」之英国、日本、联邦德国之制度，且其中任何一国都在时移事易。

Semanticists and linguistic scholars continue to remind us that words change in meaning according to time and place and circumstance. Their warnings are certainly not to be ignored. The democracy of Sweden is not identical with that which bears the same name in England, Japan, or the German Democratic Republic; and the democracy of any of these nations changes from decade to decade, from year to year.

然而，纵然语言及其所称呼之世界俱在变化，文学与文化史丰厚如斯之英语，其词汇仍然相当稳定。自莎士比亚至乔纳森ㆍ斯威夫特以至马克ㆍ吐温，乃至今日之英美（或加拿大、澳大利亚）作家，bravery 同 foolhardiness、weeping 同 whining、fury 同 rage、thought 同 delibration、desolate 同 disconsolate 之区别明晰如故。将注意引向新潮甚至昙花一现之词，及当代视域下之新义，或能取悦读者。但我想读者在领略英语词义之连续性与恒常性历经沧海桑田而不移时，将获得相同甚至更多喜悦。

Yet, with all the changes that go on both in language and in the world described by language, there are remarkable elements of stability in a vocabulary with as rich a literary and cultural history as English. The distinctions between bravery and foolhardiness, between weeping and whining, between fury and rage, between thought and deliberation, between desolate and disconsolate, remain remarkably constant through Shakespeare to Swift to Jane Austen to Mark Twain to the present-day English or American (or Canadian or Australian) writer. It is gratifying to call the reader’s attention to the many new words—even fad words—and new meanings discussed in the present volume. But I like to think that the reader will find equal pleasure—perhaps more- in the continuities and constancies in the meanings of English words that persist despite changes of time and changes of scene.

要使表达清楚精确，没有什么与分辨词义相近但不同之词同等重要。我等时时须在 transient 同 transitory、mutual 同 reciprocal、gaudy 同 garish、inherent 同 intrinsic、speculate 同 ruminate、pinnacle 同 summit 间抉择，因为某一语境下必有一词较另一词适当。用词不当将给听者或读者以模糊或错误之印象。选词应既使人明白，又使人愉快。同义词之学习会使读者更能讲出其真正欲言之事。

Nothing is so important to clear and accurate expression as the ability to distinguish between words of similar, but not identical, meaning. There are occasions in which we have to make choices between transient and transitory, mutual and reciprocal, gaudy and garish, inherent and intrinsic, speculate and ruminate, pinnacle and summit, because in a given context one is certain to be more appropriate than the other. To choose wrongly is to leave the hearer or reader with a fuzzy or mistaken impression. To choose well is to give both illumination and delight. The study of synonyms will help the reader come closer to saying what he really wants to say.
